**Abstract**

This thesis investigates 179 partnership announcements of 39 predefined companies from Ridepooling, Ridehailing, Trucking and Last-Mile deliveries with respect to partners chosen, and the reasons for partnering up. Ridepooling and Ridehailing are parts of the shared autonomous vehicle companies (SAV), whilst Trucking and Last-Mile are parts of â€œautonomous transport vehicles (ATV). 
Studying partnerships is getting more relevant due to increasing specialization of companies within their respective value chain segments which makes vertical integration within the autonomous mobility business chains more inefficient. Simultaneously high transaction costs, production costs and unsafe returns in uncertain businesses favor partnerships as a middle ground to gain access to complementary resources instead of traditional purchase agreements or vertical integration.
Answers on who the companies are will be provided in terms of industry and layer membership. Answers on why companies enter agreements will be given in terms of purposes and agreement structure, as labeled. Attempts to offer standardized labels through Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) with an ideal topic size of 13 topics turned out to be too ambiguous for reliable analysis. 
To offer more general descriptive insights into what type of companies enter partnerships, company metrics like funding, headcount and public status are correlated with the manually labeled partnership variables.
The correlation analysis revealed that highly funded and staffed companies are generally observed with lower partnership frequencies, consistent with resource-based view arguing that partnerships are especially relevant to small companies for gaining complementary resources. Also, correlations revealed that public companies co-occur with higher count of customer relevant partnerships, which is consistent with some findings on motives of public companies to report customer orientation. 
On the ATV side, lower product orientation of Last-Mile and higher focus on partnerships with customers (grocery stores and restaurants) was found. This argues for a high (product) self-sufficiency of Last-Mile companies. Also, from observing that Ridepooling and Last-Mile companies tend to engage in short-term partnerships, the study provides reasons to believe and study in future research if the Ridepooling and last-mile industry are less advanced and mature compared to Ridehailing and trucking, respectively, which show highest level of committed partnerships, involving equity. 
The contribution of the thesis is to broaden the literature on SAV and ATV beyond traditionally high technology and behavioral orientation and work for a better understanding of with whom, and for what reasons companies organize their business processes through partnerships. Also, the contributions are two landscape visualizations of the autonomous driving industry. First, through network visualization of all 179 announcements with Gephi. This also revealed that off the 39 companies under review, 17 companies were forming a denser cluster, connected either through shared partner companies or relationships between scope companies. Secondly, through BERtopic clustering of 2400 descriptions of companies claiming to belong to the AD industry, it was shown that AD is becoming a buzzword that mobility companies wrongly associate themselves with.
