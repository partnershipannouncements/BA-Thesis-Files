*This repository shows 10 files that were used to derive results for the thesis on "who and why engages in partnerships in the shared autonomous transport / autonomous transport vehicle industries".* 

**Files Chapter 3 (Data Selection)**
* 'AllInOneCSV' (Excel CSV) that shows all scraped news from newsrooms of companies included in scope.
* 'Finding_Announcements_with_keywords' (Python Code File) for filtering out news that contain partnership relevant keywords
* 'Clustering AV company descriptions' (Python Code File) for clustering more than 2400 companies flagged as belonging to the  "autonomous vehicle" industry. On basis of their Crunchbase descriptions, it was possible to illustrate the different types of companies in the industry, shedding light on the value chain to be expected in the industry.

* 'Scraping Companies', file showing the python codes used to extract news announcements from newsrooms. 


**Files Chapter 4 (Results and Discussion)**
* 'Gephi Outputs SVG' shows the output from Gephi files in SVG. To view the files, software installment is necessary (https://gephi.org/).
* 'DualCircular' (Gephi file) that shows visually the partnering companies per use case (visualizing answer to the WHO question) *
* 'Announcement Network by purpose' (Gephi file) showing visually the partnering companies and the type of purpose (i.e. reason) and structure (commitment level of partnership) per partnership (visualizing the WHY question) *
* 'Manual Labeling' (Excel File) showing manual labels (by reason and commitment) of announcements into typology of Barnes et al.. These labels are the basis for most discussions in the thesis. 
* 'Spearman Correlation' (Python Code) for efficiently calculating five correlations: one for each use case, and a correlation where all companies and their announcement labelings are correlated jointly
