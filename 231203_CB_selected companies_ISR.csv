Big O Tires;www.bigotires.com;Palm Beach Gardens;United States;Autonomous Vehicles;Transportation;Big O Tires, LLC. is North America's franchiser of tire retailers.;The Big O Tires story begins back in 1962, just as America's new love affair with the automobile was hitting high gear. The market for replacement tires was exploding, and independent tire dealers found themselves struggling to compete in the face of low prices offered by major tire manufacturers' own company stores. Big O's founding fathers were a handful of progressive independent tire dealers who decided to band together to form a tire-buying cooperative so that they could secure volume pricing and keep their customers happy. Their concept worked. In the years that followed, the Big O Tires co-op evolved into a full-fledged franchise as it continued to find innovative ways to harness the power of the collective to benefit independent dealerships and their customers. Over a half-century later, Big O Tires has become one of North America's largest retail tire franchisors, with nearly 400 independently-owned and operated locations in 19 states, providing customers with a broad range of automotive services in addition to quality tires, wheels and accessories. Big O has become an industry role model admired for its innovative approach to franchising and unmatched customer loyalty ratings. In 1996, Big O Tires joined forces with one of the largest and most respected tire marketers in the nation when it became part of the TBC Corporation, one of North America’s largest marketers of automotive replacement tires with more than 3,200 franchised and company-operated tire and automotive service centers. Through worldwide operations spanning wholesale, retail, and franchise, TBC provides customers best-in-class brands and automotive maintenance and repair services with the underlying mission to exceed customer expectations. As Big O Tires continues to thrive and adapt to an ever-changing marketplace, it remains rooted in its humble beginnings as a proud collective of independent dealers committed to putting its customers first.;True;False;False;False;Active;AV;;

Urbanavtic;urbanavtic.com;New York;United States;;Auto Insurance;Financial Services, Information Technology, Transportation;Urbanvtic is the engineering company developing the synthetic positioning platform for autonomous driving.;False;True;False;False;"Urban mobility Urban mobility problems are root in: low location accuracy (+/- 20 meters), low fidelity of speed estimation (+/- 5 kph), high latency of positioning solution accessibility (1 second delay and more), unstable signal availability (often less than 4 satellites in view), multipath of navigation signal in urban canyons, narrow and dense built areas. These parameters are unacceptable for manned and autonomous transportation in cities. That is arise the following problems for manned navigation: skipping proper turns and making wrong turns, getting on improper driveway or taking false exit on road junctions, loss of navigation and jumps of position in: urban canyons, financial districts, sky scrapers blocks, narrow and dense built areas; loss of navigation and incorrect positioning in city tunnels, nearby viaducts and overpasses, absence of navigation inside underground, under roof, multilevel parking lots, no seamless outdoor/indoor navigation. All mentioned issues makes customers unsure and unsatisfied. Autonomous/self-driving From the autonomous/self-driving point of view the goals are: decimeter grade of absolute positioning within a global reference frame, relative localization/location displacement estimation accuracy – 10 cm per 100 sec, speed estimation accuracy – 5 cm/sec, course estimation accuracy – 0,1-0,5 deg. Effective integration of navigation and machine control information sources as GNSS, IMU (gyro, accelerometer), 3D compass, Digital Map, Radar, Lidar, Image-based Positioning and Computer Vision. Solution to the navigation/positioning task mainly within GNSS+IMU+3DMap+Image-based Positioning techs. To allocate the Computer Vision and Radar/Lidar techs mostly for obstacle avoidance, objects recognition and machine control functions. Urbanavtic technology Urbanavtic approach to urban mobility and autonomous/self-driving technology solution concludes in deep engineering synthetic navigation design consist of: tight couple integration of GNSS with internal sensors (IMU) using raw data of satellite receiver, map based corrections (road graph and turns matching), image-based positioning (reference points detection and images recognition; no permanent scene analysis typical for obstacle avoidance, no high power and computation consumption). The software only product using just a platform sensors running on smartphones and in-dash auto systems. Auto insurance Auto insurance problem: it is a must to have precise motion trajectories of manned and autonomous vehicles’ in absolute and relative coordinates in case of collision happened. Traditional and unmanned vehicles collide today and will collide in future for various reasons. Perfectly reconstructed trajectories based on robust motion data opens the opportunity for automatic arbitration and resolution of road traffic incidents and accidents. Achievable centimeter accuracy of relative and decimeter accuracy of absolute positioning is the core technology for automatic collisions arbitration. High labor costs of “manual” non-automatic settlement of traffic accidents and insurance cases nowadays. Bottom line: no clear picture of road traffic accident, no data to judge who is responsible for crash, no data for crash analysis. Urbanavtic technology Urbanavtic’s auto insurance technology solution is founded on: precise relative positioning (estimation of the location displacement) based on phase measurements of GNSS and transferring to absolute coordinates using map matching methods and image-based positioning. Here we use applied measurements: GNSS raw data, primarily the accumulated phases and MEMS IMU sensors, image frames from camera. Dynamic adaptation of data processing based on a constant analysis of consistency of measurements from the phase tracking channels. Exact reconstruction of vehicles’ trajectories based on entire set of kinematic parameters including accelerations, velocities and angular velocities. Hereby we have opened the opportunity for automatic arbitration of road traffic accidents, cut costs of insurance companies, save time and money for drivers.

Secondly, this company would also develop the relative low cost and ground based 3D laser scan equipment for various applications. LiDAR stands for “Light Detection and ranging”, and it is a newly developed three dimensional (3D) digital data capturing technology. In practice, LiDAR equipment uses invisible laser beam to scan the geographic features on the earth’s surface. The equipment records the laser pulse reflections at very detailed sample location of a geographic object. It forms a digital point cloud in the computer database to depict the real world features such as buildings, bridges, and trees. Each of the points has its own real world 3D coordinates (x, y, z). The current discrepancy of the LiDAR 3D data capture and design industry is: 1. Hardware equipment of field data collection is very expensive. The major reason of this situation is that only about four companies worldwide manufacture the LiDAR survey or data collection equipment. Their major focus is to improve the accuracy and the precision of the surveying data. The owner ability of ground and tripod based LiDAR equipment worldwide is largely sacrificed. 2. The LiDAR 3D data collection and design industry lacks efficient and widely applied point cloud data processing software. Many large digital point cloud datasets were collected. However, very few accurate digital 3D data model of houses, buildings, and bridges were extracted and generated. Simply there is no effective software to classify the features hidden in the point cloud and extract them to build scaled 3D models to the real world. Development of an effective feature extraction and feature classification software is urgently needed. The;False;False;False;False;;CB;;

Products/Services: Fully automated drivers log, fleet management, rental service, pre repair diagnostics, black box, odometer temper protection, eCall, contactless payment, etc. USP/Unique Technologies/Special Know-how: 5 pending patents lay the foundation of the IP. Beside that AI offers a solution that is capable of a complete car diagnostic and not only the OBD-II protocol as some competitors offer with a complete E2E roundtrip that no solution offers. Furthermore does the security concept and RESTful API provide a unique approach that is very positively received in presentations of the solution and its capabilities. Distribution: It is a highly scalable model as the technology is based on a global standard and therefore easily rolled out after translation of language files. The multi-tiered sales approach focuses in the first instance on direct sales to B2B (e.g. fleet management, logistics providers) in the second stage B2B2C is approached (e.g. insurance companies, automobile clubs) and in the final stage the rollout is taken to the B2C market (e.g. cheap gas pumping, CO2 challenges).;False;False;False;False;;CB;;

Their engineers have developed sophisticated techniques to predict upcoming signal states. Knowing the current state of traffic lights and how they will change creates opportunities to increase driving safety, increase fuel efficiency, and improve the driving experience. Applications range from EnLighten, which tells drivers when the light they are stopped at will turn green, to vehicle powertrain optimization based on the state of upcoming lights. Safety is their number one priority. They alert drivers to possible dangers without distracting them. For example, EnLighten tells drivers stopped at red lights whether they have time to catch their breath for a few seconds, change the radio station, or pick up the papers that fell on the floor. EnLighten waits until the car stops, so the driver is not distracted, then announces how long the light will be red and gives a visual countdown. A few seconds before the light turns green, an alert sounds to tell the driver to focus on to the road. Another service They are developing warns drivers when they, or another connected vehicle, are about to run a red light. They partner with municipalities, handling the complexities of gathering real-time signal data and making it available in consistent formats for a variety of uses. Unlike other connected-vehicle technologies, their approach requires neither costly municipal infrastructure investments nor the addition of dedicated hardware to every vehicle. They communicate securely with existing traffic-signal infrastructure, and handle translation of different manufacturers' signal data to a common format.;False;False;False;False;Active;AV;;

Curb connects you to safe, reliable rides from the professional taxi and for-hire drivers nationwide. By bringing technology to the taxi and sedan experience, Curb is offering riders choice, reliability, and convenience whenever they ride. Curb’s story is told in three parts. Curb began in 2007 as RideCharge, an online service for business travelers to manage the booking and expensing of taxi rides and other local ground transportation. It soon developed a broader consumer focus, hastened by the adoption of smartphone technology. In our second iteration, Curb was Taxi Magic, the first mobile app for ordering a ride, on-demand. After Apple introduced the App Store as a distribution platform for consumer apps, we built Taxi Magic upon our existing technology and released it in January 2009. Over the next five years, we built a nationwide network of riders, drivers, and taxi companies. In that time, our technology-powered millions of rides and highlighted the challenges facing everyday travelers. In August 2014, Taxi Magic became a Curb to deliver an improved ride experience and consumer choice to ground travelers everywhere. All rides begin and end at the curb, and our technology improves the entire experience from curb to curb by eradicating underlying pain points and making ground travel seamless and hassle-free. Now, Curb is consistently ranked in the Top 50 for “Travel & Tourism” in the App Store and the Android Marketplace. In addition, we have built the Curb Passenger Information Monitor (PIM) that supports credit card payment and entertaining video content. The Curb Network consists of 35,000 taxis with 90 fleets in 60 US cities. By aligning riders, drivers, and fleets, Curb offers a better overall ride experience. The company was founded in 2007 and headquartered in Long Island City, New York.;False;False;False;False;Active;Neckermann;;

To do this, it uses the collection of differential data that determines the risk profile of drivers so that they can offer a discount on insurance. The company, founded in 2017 bySancho Atienza, Jesús Bernat, José Luis Blanco, Marina Martínez, Víctor Manuel GarcíaandLaura García, has developed an app that automatically detects how the user drives and offers you a fun and social way to put your driving fit while redeeming discounts and rewards around the automotive world. The founders saw a great business opportunity in a social, useful and advantageous service for all agents in the world of insurance. Drivies substantially improves risk prediction, attracts users looking to benefit from offers and discounts and turns those users into potential customers for insurance companies. The application is available in Spain, where more than 120,000 users are registered. The Drivies initiative was born within Telefónica I + D as an intra-entrepreneurship program. Therefore, despite the fact that the company was established independently only a few months ago, today it has a team of 18 people. Although the capital of the company is under the control of the management team, they did manage to close a round of € 500,000 with the support of small investors, who are mainly family and friends. The company arises in response to a problem in the insurance industry, unable to grow profitably due to the lack of differentiation and intense competition. Its value proposition to the user does not focus on the insurance itself, because it is something that users remember once a year, associating it with negative moments, such as accidents and expenses. Drivies is a fun and social tool that helps you drive better, more efficiently and safely, with a rewards model and tools that solve problems related to fines, location, ITV, economy, etc.;False;False;False;False;Active;AV;;

Insight;www.sweptlaser.com/;Lafayette;United States;Semiconductor;Hardware, Science and Engineering;Insight has developed an Akinetic, all semiconductor laser: a platform technology.;Insight has developed an Akinetic, all semiconductor laser: a platform technology with a step-change in performance for multiple applications including Industrial maintenance and processes monitoring for resource efficiency, LiDAR, and Medical Imaging. Laser imaging currently relies on Time-Of-Flight measurement, measuring the timing of light pulses hitting target and returning to receiver. This method has inherent limitations that has prevented 3D imaging quality improvements and application of technology within new sectors. Alternative methods require lasers to sweep across a range of frequencies, with incumbent technologies relying on kinetic technology which suffer from low speed, low durability, and susceptibility to vibration and shocks. Insight Photonics has developed a solid state all-semiconductor akinetic swept laser chip which can image faster (2-20x), with higher resolution (10x), and with higher sensitivity (10-100x) than current competitors, using Optical Coherence Technology (OCT). Akinetic operation results in greater durability and reliability than competitive OCT solutions, whilst also offering higher quality output at broad range of wavelengths.

Based on 20+ years of research from the University of Washington (UW), our hybrid organic electro-optic technology enables low-voltage, low-power, high-performance transfer of data between electronics (the ubiquitous computer chip) and photonics (the technology used in fiber optics, LIDAR, and other groundbreaking technologies). NLM’s technology enables tighter and more efficient integration of electronics and ultra-fast photonics. NLM’s Hybrid Organic EO (OEO) Technology is a patented combination of materials and process technologies, enabling efficient EO modulation in datacenter and computing hardware that meets the demand of future growth in networking for AI and other applications. Photonics is transforming networking, computing, and sensing. The largest use to date has been for data transmission and networking in telecom and datacenter infrastructure, using light to efficiently move data over fiber optic networks. Silicon photonics is the incumbent platform for integrated photonics in datacenter network hardware, but signal conversion between electronics and photonics on this platform is power-hungry and cannot scale to sufficient bandwidth to meet future needs in AI and other applications. This has created a need for alternative electro-optic (EO) modulation technologies that can be integrated with silicon photonics and address this bottleneck. Alternate emerging modulation technologies have limitations in bandwidth, device footprint, thermal stability, or cost and complexity of integration with silicon photonics and conventional CMOS VLSI electronics. NLM’s Hybrid Organic EO (OEO) Technology uniquely solves these issues. It can be retrofitted into silicon photonics processes in late-stage advanced packaging steps, minimize changes to complex chipmaking processes and infrastructure while providing superior modulator power efficiency (10-1000×) and enabling scalable bandwidth. The technology can be deployed through multiple fabs as a semiconductor IP block for broad reach, and has been demonstrated at leading translational research fabs, leading to extensive recent interest by hyperscale datacenter operators and commercial fabs. NLM’s deployment is also accelerated by strategic investors including TOK (a major photoresist manufacturer with extensive materials supply agreements with fabs) and photonics components leader Hamamatsu Photonics.;False;False;False;False;;CB;;

Users receive more complete and consistent data than current manually collected road assessment methods at a lower cost. It is also significantly less expense than LIDAR-based approaches. Using fleet-sourced data collection from windshield mounted devices, Road Triage delivers results that are current, comprehensive, and consistent – without the drawbacks of human subjectivity. Workers avoid hazardous situations while collecting data. In addition to improving the allocation of maintenance resources, the resulting data supports root cause analysis, and predictive asset decay studies. Data Rich: Road Triage provides actionable data with road segment scores for lane lines and pavement distress such as potholes, patches, multiple crack types, and pavement edge issues. These are color-coded, assessed/scored, and geo-tagged. Ride quality is also analyzed identifying bumps, dips/lifts, and roughness. Images are provided for identified issues. This level of detail provides a better understanding of road conditions without having to visit in person. Online management reports include quantified data visualization, maps, and exportable datasets for use in popular spreadsheet and GIS software. High Quality: The value of data depends on its quality. Road Triage’s AI algorithms consistently and accurately identify and assess pavement distress issues and lane lines. When compared to manual data collection and assessment methodology, Road Triage removes human subjectivity - resulting in more consistent and accurate results. Furthermore, the AI models are regularly updated and retrained. A team of specialists combs through new data enabling the AI models to learn from new experiences. Reduced Costs and Safety: High-quality road data at a low price is the cornerstone of Road Triage. The current process requires expensive LIDAR equipment and/or dedicated field staff to drive and walk the roads. This approach is dangerous for the workers walking unprotected on active roadways. Using Road Triage, road data are collected while fleets drive their typical routes, with no additional effort required for most roads. For roads not covered by typical fleet operations, data can be collected by simply driving them. There is no need to exit the vehicle and manually evaluate the roads. The reduced data collection and processing effort translates into a lower cost with increased data quality and frequency. Additionally, reconstructing roads costs approximately four times more than resurfacing them. Road Triage can provide asset conditions of the entire road network supporting early intervention thus reducing long-term costs and improving roadway safety. USDOT Road to Zero: Road Triage supports the vision and goals of the USDOT Road to Zero initiative – a collaborative effort among the NHTSA, FHWA, FMCSA, NSC, and state DOTs with the goal of ending fatalities on the nation’s roads. According to the USDOT, the lack of adequate roadway safety features and poor roadway condition are likely a significant contributing factor to motor vehicle accidents. The timely identification and assessment of poor roadway markings and pavement distress from Road Triage can be instrumental to keeping roadways in optimal operational condition. Robocist works with state and local transportation organizations, adding value to their transportation networks by providing quantifiable access to current, relevant roadway data, asset conditions, and the associated trends that support efficient asset management.;False;False;False;False;Active;AV;;

Our goal is to make “Human-Friendly” a standard as stringent as UL labeling to identify a Drobotic vehicle as opposed to a drone. It’s OK dad, it’s a Drobot. First, Drobots are controlled by TrackPaths, not flown by humans. TrackPaths contain a “hard fence” concept where the vehicle is guaranteed not to cross the hard fence without positive control. Second, the control electronics in the safety systems are all hardware, not software, and the probability of failure of those electronics have to be calculated at less than 0.0000000001 in 1000 hours of operation. Third, no SPF or Single Point of Failure. Everything has a backup. Fourth Terminal Flight Avoidance / Positive Control means that even if the bird is coming down, it is still capable of looking for clear landing space or deploying some mechanism to mitigate terminal velocity and force of impact. Finally, privacy. People all over the country (and world) are reporting being “spied on” by drones in their own back yards.
